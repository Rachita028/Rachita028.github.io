My major project at USask was on petroleum and hence I had a lot to contribute to this course. Along with grading the assignments/exams, creating quizes, and hosting office hours, I gave practical demonstrations of parr reactor and trickle bed reactor working under hydrotreating conditions through videos of my own reactor systems and also helped the instructor with the hydrotreating catalyst to show it to the class. This was a great experience of hand-on teaching and live demonstrations in classroom setting.
