I have thoroughly enjoyed working as a TA for this course. The first time I was TAing this course, my duties involved– providing homework solutions on canvas, grading the homework and exams and holding office hours for the UGs. 

The second time I TAed this course, the objective was to transform the course from a non-coding class to using python workflows and scripts to help the UGs familiarize with python and use codes for solving thermodynamics problems. While I was grading the homework, exams and performing all the regular duties as a TA; holding office hours to help students learn python and see them get confident towards the end of the Quarter was extremely rewarding.
