The goal of this talk was to demonstrate the ability of QuantEXAFS to measure the site heterogeneities using EXAFS and DFT. An automated workflow of combined experimental and computational methods to quantify sites in atomically dispersed catalysts, this leads to a better understanding of targeted site-controlled synthesis, activity, and stability.
