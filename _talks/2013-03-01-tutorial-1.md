Screening of TMs to understand the nature of atomically dispersed sites was successfully accomplished and the trends for the most commonly used TMsâ€“ Ni, Pd, and Pt on MgO were experimentally studied. This experiment-theory integrated synthesis creates a pathway towards predictive and well-defined site synthesis for targeted stability and activity.
