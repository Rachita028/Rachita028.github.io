**Research Interests:** 
**Catalysis for sustainable energy (experimental catalysis)–** catalyst design, synthesis and testing. 
**Spectroscopic methods** for catalyst characterization.
**Computational catalysis–** molecular simulations, microkinetic modelling, and studying the reaction intermidiates.

I am a Chemical Engineering Ph.D. Candidate at [University of California, Davis](https://che.engineering.ucdavis.edu/) co-advised by [Dr. Ambarish Kulkarni](https://kulkarni.sf.ucdavis.edu/) and [Dr. Simon Bare](https://profiles.stanford.edu/simon-bare). My current research focuses on implementing Quantum chemistry methods to understad the nature of catalytic sites in combination with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). My major project involves development of the automated workflow [QuantEXAFS](https://github.com/kul-group/QuantEXAFS) that uses high-throughput atomistic simulations to fit XAS data. The catalyst system I work on is atomically dispsered catalyst. While my project focuses on computaional catalysis where calculating phase diagrams and reaction barriers is essential; I also conducts beamline experiments at [Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource](https://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/) and take interest in synthesis. My prior experience as an experimentalist in a catalysis laboratory and the current computational catalysis training, motivates me to combine the two powerful techniques towards the development and enhanced fundamental understanding of efficient catalytic systems.  

I obtained my MS degree in Chemical Engineering from [University of Saskatchewan](https://engineering.usask.ca/departments/cbe.php#AbouttheDepartment) under the supervision of [Dr. Ajay K. Dalai](https://engineering.usask.ca/people/cbe/dalai,ajay.php#research_areas) and a Bachelors degree from India. My Masters research was focused on understanding the deactivation trends of catalyst during hydrotreating of gas oil. Here, I gained experience of working on continuous and batch reactors and using various catalyst characterization techniques. I conducted experiments at [Canadian Light Source](https://www.lightsource.ca/index.php) that inspired me to do a Ph.D. on a related project.

My motivation towards research comes from the forever existing quest to explore new opportunities to make catalysts that can be energy efficient and environment-friendly.
