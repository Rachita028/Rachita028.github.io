Rachita Rana is a Chemical Engineering PhD student at [UC Davis](https://che.engineering.ucdavis.edu/) co-advised by [Dr. Ambarish Kulkarni](https://kulkarni.sf.ucdavis.edu/) and [Dr. Simon Bare] (https://profiles.stanford.edu/simon-bare). Her current research focuses on implementing Quantum chemistry methods to understad the nature of catalytic sites in combination with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Her major project involves development of the automated workflow [QuantEXAFS] (https://github.com/kul-group/QuantEXAFS) that using high-throughput atomistic simulations to fit XAS data. The catalyst system she works on is atomically dispsered catalyst. While her project focuses on computaional catalysis where calculating phase diagrams and reaction barriers is essential; she also conducts beamline experiments at [SSRL] (https://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/) and takes interest in synthesis. Her prior experience as an experimentalist in a catalysis laboratory and the current computational catalysis training, motivates her to combine the two powerful techniques towards the development and enhanced fundamental understanding of efficient catalytic systems.  

She obtained her MS degree in Chemical Engineering from [University of Saskatchewan](https://engineering.usask.ca/departments/cbe.php#AbouttheDepartment) under the supervision of [Dr. Ajay K. Dalai](https://engineering.usask.ca/people/cbe/dalai,ajay.php#research_areas) and a Bachelors degree from India. Her Masters research was focused on understanding the deactivation trends of catalyst during hydrotreating of gas oil. Here, she gained experience of working on continuous and batch reactors and using various catalyst characterization techniques. She conducted experiments at [CLS] (https://www.lightsource.ca/index.php) that inspired her to do a Ph.D. on a related project.

Her motivation towards research comes from the forever existing quest to explore new opportunities to make catalysts that can be energy efficient and environment-friendly.
